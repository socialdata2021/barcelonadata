							<p>
								Globalization has changed how people, companies and governments of different countries interact. It is true that this is providing us a lot of benefits regarding professional opportunities, allowing us to meet more people, discover new cultures, and the possibility to visit new countries. However, tourism has taken an excessive relevant role in the daily life in Barcelona these last years, starting to negatively affect its citizens. As an example, its main effect might have been its influence in altering the housing prices.
								<br>
								<br>
								Since some years ago, Barcelona has suffered, like most of the big capitals in Europe, a disproportionate increase of the rental prices. In the following analysis, these prices and trends are compared between neighbourhoods and, in order to find a possible explanation of this price raise, this Section analyses until what extent they are related to the increase of tourism. This tourism increase can be quantified with the number of AirBnBs apartment rents over the years, as it provides an idea of how many foreigners are coming to visit Barcelona.
								<br>
								<br>
							</p>

							<p style="text-align:center;">
								<iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/yearly_prices.html" height="400" width="600"></iframe>
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Several studies have already connected the Barcelona housing crisis with the gentrification processes arising in the city, as a higher number of AirBnBs means a lower offer of available flats for renting for its neighbours, leading to an increase of rental prices which finally result in an undesirable bubble and housing speculation.
								<br>
								<br>
								Therefore, this section provides different visualizations of the relationship between rental prices and AirBnBs in all neighborhoods in order to help politicians to take decisions such as regulating the housing market as well as the touristic apartments, controlling the touristics effect on the city and limiting the rental price. All these analyses by neighbourhoods can allow you to understand different patterns among areas in Barcelona and try to minimize sudden changes in particular areas that can affect its neighbours' wellbeing and housing stability in order to protect, specially young people and families with low income.
								<br>
								<br>
								Finally, this section is also useful for people looking for a new place to move in. The following interactive images give you the opportunity to investigate how the housing market in Barcelona is and have a first idea of which neighbourhoods would suit Barcelona's new citizens the best taking into account their income. Besides, they could find out how dependent each neighbourhood is from the touristic sector and its resulting social implications.
								<br>
								<br>
								From the first plot above, it is possible to see the homogeneous increase of mÂ² rental price in all neighbourhoods. Navigate yourself to check current prices and their changes from last years. 
								<br>
								<br>
								However, it is more interesting to see the high percentage of increase in the price in each year with respect to 2014. Surprisingly, the largest percentage of price increase are in the suburbs and more humble neighbourhoods of Barcelona, meaning that the touristic implications on the housing crisis are not focused in the city center, where most of the AirBnBs are located, but it is structural and affecting to Barcelona as a whole.
								<br>
								<br>
							</p>

							<p style="text-align:center;">
								<iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/yearly_updates.html" height="400" width="600"></iframe>
							</p>

							<p>
								Besides, it is relevant to see that the rental price increase is not related to the absolute population or increase of density in the neighbourhoods from 2015-2019. Neighbourhoods with higher number of habitants or Density of population could have suffered a lower increase of rental price as they might be considered more humble areas, but it is not seen in this analysis.
								<br>
								<br>

							<p style="text-align:center;">
								<iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/percent_rent_price_increase_vs_density2019.html" height="400" width="600"></iframe>
							</p>
							
							<p>
								At this point, the following interactive data visualizations should let you become aware about the impact of the growing number of AirBnBs over the years to the housing prices increase.
								<br>
								<br>
								As a starting point, it is important to see how the number of AirBnBs have increased along the years in the different neighbourhoods. Makes sense to see that the 2 districts in the city center have most of the AirBnBs of the city. Moreover, Sants-MontjuÃ¯c and Sant MartÃ­ AirBnB also increased recently, because of their touristic interest due to their proximity to the mount MontjuÃ¯c and the beach respectively.
								<br>
								<br>

							<div class="row">
								<div style="float:left;">
								    <div align="center">
								        <iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/airbnb_years_bar.html" height="600" width="600"></iframe>
								    </div>
								</div>
								<div style="float:right;">
								    <div align="center">
								        <iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/total_airbnbs_map.html" height="600" width="600"></iframe>
								    </div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>
								At this point it is interesting to see how this Airbnbs increase correlates with the percentage of rental price increase of each year with respect to 2014. It is relevant to see that Sant MartÃ­ and Sants-MontjuÃ¯c are neighbourhoods having the highest percentage of price increase according to the also increased number of AirBnBs. Therefore, they are starting to follow trends similar to the ones that Ciutat Vella and Eixample started following since their first AirBnBs in 2014.
								<br>
								<br>
								Public administration should take this information into consideration in order to prevent these 2 rising districts from ending up being as expensive as Eixample or Ciutat Vella. Otherwise, a continuous increase of this trend will decrease the number of available flats to rent for citizens of Barcelona, increasing flat prices and therefore forcing people to move out of  their neighbourhood, leading to a structural increase of prices in all Barcelona.
								<br>
								<br>

							<p style="text-align:center;">
								<iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/update_price_vs_airbnb_years.html" height="450" width="750"></iframe>
							</p>

							<p>
								As you have seen that there is an increase in rental prices and also in Airbnb, it is necessary to know whether all these tourist flats are following the law to reduce housing speculation. 
								<br>
								<br>
							</p>

							<table>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td valign="top">
											<p>
												For this reason, in the following plot, the AirBnBs locations of the 10 landlords owning the most number of flats are shown. Note that each of them own more than 80 flats in Barcelona! And the 2 top ones own more than 140.
												<br>
												<br>
												See that most of their apartments are located near to touristic points of interest, with the purpose of maximizing their chances to obtain customers. Public administration should take this information into consideration in order to avoid âtouristic-ghettosâ, which could be harmful for their citizens' wellbeing and contribute to the bubble of the housing market.

										<td width = "60%">
											<iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/airbnbs_5_landlords.html" height="400" width="600"></iframe>
										</td>
									</tr>
								</tbody>
							</table>

							<p>
								Moreover, families should consider this information when looking for a place to settle down, as they would prefer to live in a neighbourhood where to create a small friendly network with other families with children rather than areas with a high number of tourists, and its consequent noise and nightlife. 
								<br>
								<br>
							</p>

							<table>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td width = "60%">
											<iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="plots/mean_price_vs_airbnbs_year.html" height="400" width="600"></iframe>
										</td>
										<td valign="top">
											<p>
												The increase of AirBnBs in Barcelona have also contributed to increasing mean price differences between neighbourhoods. Whereas in 2014 it was possible to identify 3 types of neighbourhoods: the richest (Pedralbes, Vallvidrera, les Tres Torres), the humblest (neighbourhoods in Nou Barris and Sants-MontjuÃ¯c districts) and the neighbourhoods from Eixample and Ciutat Vella in the city center; in 2020 all of them increased, turning Ciutat Vella almost as much expensive area as lâEixample. 
												<br>
												<br>
											</p>
										</td>
									</tr>
								</tbody>
							</table>

							<p>
								However, the most interesting insight is the new type of neighbourhood resulting from the gentrification in Barcelona. All Sant MartÃ­ and Sants-MontjuÃ¯c neighbourhoods, and, for instance, la Vila OlÃ­mpica and Sant Gervasi - Galvany, have higher increase in their mean price as a result of their recent increase in touristic flats, reaching rental prices as high as in renowned richer neighbourhoods such as Pedralbes, Vallvidrera and les Tres Torres.
								<br>
								<br>
								With this result, Barcelona City Council could try to minimize this touristic impact in these emergent neighbourhoods and prevent the humblest districts to become as much expensive in the long term.
								<br>
								<br>
							</p>

							<table>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td valign="top">
											<p>
												Finally, summing up all the data observed at this point, using the ratio of number of AirBnBs per number of houses similar patterns arise. Ratio values from Sant MartÃ­ neighbourhoods are close to Ciutat Vella and Eixample, explaining the high price increase since 2014. Barcelona should stop giving touristic flat licenses to Sant MartÃ­ in order to prevent even higher prices and its neighbourhoods to become another economically exclusive area to live such as flats in lâEixample.
