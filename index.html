								This webpage is the final project for the course Social data and visualizations (02806) offered by the Technical University of Denmark. <br>
							</h3>
							<p>								
								Nowadays, big cities are facing the exciting but also hard challenge of finding the balance between keeping themselves open to our globalized society with extremely fast technology developments and changes while maintaining its citizens' wellbeing and happiness. This is the reason why public administrations and governments tend to be widely criticized on a daily basis, losing its popularity and credibility, contributing to the transformation of this general social discontent into an increase of extremist ideas and fake news.
 								<br>
								<br>
								For this reason, with this website, we are proposing to the Barcelona City Council and its City Planning Department a tool that is highlighting some of the current socio-economic trends in Barcelona as well as pointing out some of the most relevant challenges that the city is facing nowadays. 
								<br>
								<br>
								We decided to divide this website and our analysis into 3 representative topics of the citizens’ wellbeing: Housing, Pollution and Socio-economic aspects. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Firstly, Barcelona is suffering, like most of the big capitals in Europe, a disproportionate increase of the rental prices. Several studies have already shown that this housing crisis is due to the gentrification processes arising in Barcelona since tourism took an excessive relevant role in the city in the last years. In this section, we focus on analysing the m² rent price and increase and how related they are to the growing number of AirBnBs in the city.
								<br>
								<br>
								Secondly, air quality is also a big concern which cities have recently agreed to face all together in order to revert climate change and the unsustainable strain our planet is under, due to the rise in population and increased consumption of natural resources. In this section, we investigate which are the compounds polluting the most different neighbourhoods of Barcelona
								<br>
								<br>
								Furthormore, we also analyse different aspects related to the wellbeing of families in Barcelona such as familiar income, unemployment rate or access to different education possibilities among different neighbourhoods.
								<br>
								<br>
								Finally, Covid data and analysis of the current situation is also included in the website to provide a daily update about and how the pandemics is affecting each neighbourhood since its outbreak.
								<br>
								<br>
								Furthermore, we believe that this website can be used to help to obtain a first idea of how livable the city of Barcelona is nowadays and also for the following 2 purposes:
								<br>
								<br>
								A platform to help identify and understand trends and patterns in the everyday life of the city in order to make Barcelona a more friendly, fair and habitable city for its citizens. The different analysis that we include in the website can be used by the public administration to determine where to put their focus on when starting to address some of the big issues and topics we chose to show from Barcelona.
								<br>
								<br>
								As a guide to provide to families which are moving to Barcelona for living or working, to allow them to obtain a first idea about the city, and help them on their choices about their future life. The same 3 topics mentioned above are used to show some features and singularities about Barcelona. For instance, using this website, families could have access to data and information about where to find affordable accommodation taking into account different aspects of each neighbourhood: tourism, to get an idea of its possible consequences such as noise; harmful pollution or polluted-free areas; or get a first feeling about the number of schools and number of families with children in the neighbourhood.
